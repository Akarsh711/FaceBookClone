High Priority:
    He have made his store and  Browser router in index.js,
    but because he is using older version. since, I can't understand I made this in App.js.
    - useRef, useEffect
    - JWT, mail outh
    - learn bout useSelector

Low Priority:
    - update reducer, instead use reducer tool kit. and offcourse learn more bout it
    - Understand that Date thing used in sign up form
    - We use loading in forget password I think it is of no use so please check.


Key learnings:
   
    - useReducer returns updated state based on actions and can be used instead of useState.
      App.js contains a function reducer for more reference.
      As loading, error, posts state needs to be updated in all frequently so to make it more convinient etc. etc.
